# Weather-Forecast

This Python project is a Weather Forecast Application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. Users can search for weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and current conditions, for any city worldwide. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly and visually appealing. Additionally, users can save their favorite locations, which are stored locally in a JSON file, and easily view them through the app.

The code demonstrates an integration of API requests, JSON handling, and GUI development. It includes error handling to provide meaningful feedback when something goes wrong, such as entering an invalid city name or network connectivity issues. The project is an excellent starting point for those interested in combining Python programming with API integrations and desktop application development.

This code was initially developed as part of a course Python project. Later, it is updated with more/new features. 

In addition, the code includes:
a. 5-Day Forecast: Added a function fetch_forecast to fetch and display the 5-day weather forecast.
b. Remove Favorite Locations: Added the ability to remove locations from the favorites list.
c. Dark Mode: Configured the GUI with a dark theme for better usability.
